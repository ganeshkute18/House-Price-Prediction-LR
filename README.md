 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
 Project Overview
This project implements a Linear Regression Model to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The model helps estimate property values based on historical data, aiding real estate businesses and buyers in making informed decisions.

 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
Square Footage
Number of Bedrooms
Number of Bathrooms
House Price (Target Variable)ðŸ”¬ Methodology
Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables (if any).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Understanding the data distribution and correlations.
Model Training â€“ Implementing and training a Linear Regression model.
Model Evaluation â€“ Using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess performance.

 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Results & Insights
The trained model predicts house prices based on input features with reasonable accuracy, demonstrating the relationship between property attributes and pricing trends.
