🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Linear Regression Model to predict house prices based on key property features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. By leveraging historical data, this model helps real estate professionals and buyers make informed decisions about property values. 🏠📊

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains the following key features:

Square Footage 📏

Number of Bedrooms 🛏️

Number of Bathrooms 🚿

House Price (Target Variable) 💰

🔬 Methodology

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

✔ Handle missing values
✔ Feature scaling (if necessary)
✔ Encode categorical variables (if any)

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✔ Understand data distribution using visualizations 📈
✔ Identify correlations between features 🧐
✔ Detect outliers and anomalies

3️⃣ Model Training

✔ Implement and train a Linear Regression model using Scikit-Learn
